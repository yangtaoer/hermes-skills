# Hermes Tweet

## Collection Note

This repository already stores API-oriented Hermes skills. Hermes Tweet adds a
social automation route for X/Twitter search, tweet/reply reading, profile
lookup, monitoring, follower export, and approval-gated actions.

Use this ASK-compatible wrapper when a Hermes Agent user needs the native Hermes
Tweet plugin for X/Twitter automation through Xquik.

## Install

Install the native plugin in Hermes Agent:

```bash
hermes plugins install Xquik-dev/hermes-tweet --enable
hermes tools list
```

Set `XQUIK_API_KEY` in the Hermes runtime environment before using authenticated
read or action tools. Do not paste the key into chat.

## When to Use

Use Hermes Tweet for:

- scrape/search tweets or search Twitter/X
- read tweet replies and tweet details
- look up users and public profiles
- monitor tweets or accounts
- export followers and following lists
- post tweets/replies, send DMs, or automate X actions after explicit approval

## Tool Flow

1. Use `tweet_explore` to find the catalog endpoint.
2. Use `tweet_read` for public read-only endpoints.
3. Use `tweet_action` only for approved writes, private reads, monitors,
   webhooks, extraction jobs, giveaway draws, or media operations.

## Safety

- Never ask for API keys, passwords, cookies, or TOTP secrets.
- Never pass credentials in tool arguments.
- Use only catalog-listed `/api/v1/...` endpoints.
- Copied endpoint URLs are accepted only when they resolve to catalog-listed paths.
- Keep write actions gated behind `HERMES_TWEET_ENABLE_ACTIONS=true`.
- Summarize the exact action before posting, replying, sending DMs, or changing
  account state.

## Permissions and Trust

- Tool scope: use only `tweet_explore`, `tweet_read`, and `tweet_action` through
  the enabled Hermes Tweet toolset.
- Network scope: call only catalog-listed Xquik API routes through those tools.
  Do not create direct HTTP fallbacks.
- File scope: do not write files, logs, screenshots, cached payloads, or
  credentials unless the user asks for an explicit export workflow.
- Environment scope: check only whether `XQUIK_API_KEY`,
  `HERMES_TWEET_ENABLE_ACTIONS`, and `HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS` are
  configured. Never request or echo values.
- Output: return concise Markdown summaries, action previews, or JSON-like tool
  payloads. `tweet_action` may change account or workflow state only after
  explicit approval.
- Release gate: do not present this skill as NVIDIA-verified unless the release
  includes a clean SkillSpector review, `skill-card.md`, Tier-3 eval data,
  `BENCHMARK.md`, `skill.oms.sig`, and signature verification instructions.
